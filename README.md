## Abstract
Traditionally, software development has been predominantly supported by a variety of non-AI tools and methodologies. However, with the introduction of Generative AI (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, the landscape has changed significantly, opening up new opportunities to improve all activities that are part of the software development process. To explore the usage of GenAI in different areas of Software Engineering (SE) as defined by the SWEBOK: _Requirements_, _Architecture and Design_, _Construction_, _Testing_, and _Maintenance_, a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) was conducted using the SCOPUS database, obtaining a total of 256 studies, of which 48 were selected as primary studies. The results indicate that GenAI is most widely used in the areas of _Construction_ and _Testing_, improving efficiency by automating repetitive and structured tasks. In contrast, areas that require more creativity and strategic thinking pose significant challenges for the evolution of GenAI, where improving the synergy between GenAI and human experience is essential. Therefore, it is important that future efforts focus on evolving GenAI capabilities to better address these gaps and expand its role throughout the SE discipline.
